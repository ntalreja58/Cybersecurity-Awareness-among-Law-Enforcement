# Cybersecurity-Awareness-among-Law-Enforcement

## Project Proposal
I planned to study the survey data collected in a study of Law Enforcement Officers (LEOs) awareness of vehicle cybersecurity. The study was conducted by me in the Human Performance Lab under Professor Shannon Roberts. The aim of the study was to investigate the association between cybersecurity training and officers’ understanding of cybersecurity concepts applicable to police vehicle systems. By taking into account demographic variables such as age groups, education levels, years of experience, and hours spent in police vehicles, I planned to study how these variables interact with the level of cybersecurity training to influence officers’ understanding of cybersecurity in police vehicles. I planned to conduct statistical analysis to understand the connection between the demographic variables and the understanding of vehicular cybersecurity. I planned to use regression modeling and hypothesis testing to determine the level of understanding LEOs had of vehicular cybersecurity before and after their training. I also plan to look into the difference in understanding in the two groups - Experimental and Sham. The aim of my study is to contribute to the understanding of cybersecurity training, both vehicular and otherwise, for LEOs. The aim is to understand if the training model created works best for enhancing officers’ cybersecurity awareness specific to police vehicle systems. With my study, I hope to provide strategies for improving the training models relating to cybersecurity in the Law Enforcement Department.

## Research Question
How do demographic characteristics such as age, education level, years of experience, and hours spent in police cars impact Law Enforcement Officers' awareness of vehicular cybersecurity? 

## Hypothesis
- Cybersecurity training greatly enhances LEOs' grasp of vehicular cybersecurity. 
- Age, education, years of experience, and hours spent in police cars all have a substantial interaction effect on officers' grasp of vehicular cybersecurity, as does the quality of cybersecurity training. 
- The Training group will have a far better awareness of vehicular cybersecurity than the Sham group. 

## Demographic Plots:

Demographic plots were created to understand the sample population. The demographic plots provided an overview of the participants' characteristics, including age group and gender distribution. These plots helped in understanding the composition of the study sample and assessing whether the sample was representative of the target population or if there were any potential biases.

## Experimental and Sham Plots:

Plots were created to understand the data and their commonalities between the Experimental and Sham groups. The experimental and sham plots illustrate the differences between the two study groups: the experimental group that received specialized cybersecurity training and the sham group that did not. The bar plot compares the levels of anxiety or concern about cyberattacks on police cars between the two groups. The higher anxiety levels in the experimental group suggested that the cybersecurity training was effective in increasing awareness and concern about potential cyber threats. These plots provide visual evidence of the training's impact and support the study's hypothesis.

## Analysis:

The analysis section includes a correlation analysis (correlation.png) and a regression analysis (lm1.png, lm2.png). The correlation analysis examines the relationships between different variables, such as gender, age, cybercrime experience, training, and concern about cyberattacks on police vehicles. It highlights some unexpected findings, like the negative correlation between gender and other variables, and the positive correlation between training and concern about cyberattacks, which aligns with the study's hypothesis.

The regression analysis investigates the association between the study groups (experimental and sham) and the concern about cyberattacks on police vehicles (Q19). While the analysis suggests an association, it is not statistically significant at conventional levels. However, the researchers acknowledge the need for a larger sample size to obtain more robust and statistically significant results.

Overall, the analysis section provides insights into the relationships between various factors and the impact of cybersecurity training on the participants' perceptions and concerns.
